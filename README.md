# Editor Full Screen

Enhance your Obsidian experience with two distraction-free editing modes.

### Features

- **Full Screen Mode**: Only file content shown, status bar hidden by default (Ctrl+Alt+F recommended)
- **Zen Mode**: File content with navigation bar visible (Alt+F recommended)

Move cursor to left edge to show ribbon, top edge for headers. Adapts to window resizing and splits.

### Settings

- Choose start-up mode: Normal, Full Screen, or Zen Mode

### Usage

**Commands**:

- **Toggle Full screen mode**: Activate full screen, switch from zen to full screen, or deactivate if already in full screen
- **Toggle Zen mode**: Activate zen, switch from full screen to zen, or deactivate if already in zen

**Smart switching**: Direct switching between modes without going through normal mode.

**Mouse Controls**: Move mouse to screen edges to temporarily reveal hidden interface elements.

Use command palette or customize hotkeys in Obsidian settings.

Enjoy your focused writing experience!

## Development

This plugin uses a template that automates the development and publication processes on GitHub, including releases. You can develop either inside or outside your Obsidian vault.

### Environment Setup

#### File Structure

- All source files must be in the `src` folder:
  - `main.ts`
  - `styles.css`

> **Note:** If `styles.css` is accidentally placed in the root folder instead of `src`, it will be automatically moved to the correct location when running any development command. After building, a copy of `styles.css` will appear in the root folder as part of the normal release process.

#### Development Options

1. **Inside the vault's plugins folder:**

   - Delete the `.env` file
   - Run npm commands as usual

2. **Outside the vault:**
   - Set the paths in the `.env` file:
     - `TestVault` for development
     - `RealVault` for production simulation
   - Necessary files will be automatically copied to the targeted vault

### Available Commands

- `npm run start`: Opens VS Code, runs `npm install`, then `npm run dev`
- `npm run dev`: For development
- `npm run build`: Builds the project
- `npm run real`: Simulates a traditional plugin installation in your REAL vault
- `npm run bacp`: Builds, adds, commits, and pushes (prompts for commit message)
- `npm run acp`: Adds, commits, and pushes (without building)
- `npm run version`: Updates version, modifies relevant files, then adds, commits, and pushes
- `npm run release`: Creates a GitHub release (prompts for release title, can be multiline using `\n`)

### Recommended Workflow

1. `npm run start`
2. `npm run bacp`
3. `npm run version`
4. `npm run release`

### Additional Features

- **obsidian-typings**: This template automatically includes obsidian-typings, providing access to additional types not present in the official API.
